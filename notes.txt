* Internet
- The internet is a global network of computers where each computer/router has
an IP address to uniquely identify them, just like a home address. 
- IP addresses are assigned to you by your internet service provider, e.g. 
73.158.6.61.
- Even if you have multiple devices in your home, each of these devices all have 
a private IP address that is only local to your home network. 
- Your router has a public IP address and that's the address the internet 
actually sees. All the private ones for each device are only within your home 
network or office network. 
- The way computers talk to eachother is over the TCP/IP protocol. A protocol 
is a way for computers to communicate.
- HTTP is an application layer protocol, which runs over TCP, that is responsible
for handling web traffic between a browser and a web server. 
- Other application layer protocols include SMTP which deals with emails, FTP 
and SSH deal with transferring files over the internet.
- Websites/webpages are files stored on computers that run a piece of software
called a web server. 
- You can build a website on your local machine and then you would upload it to 
a server that a hosting company owns. 
- Domain names can be purchased from registrars and linked to your hosting 
account/web server. 
- When you type in 'http://www.facebook.com' there's something called a DNS
or domain name service that maps that domain to the correct IP address of 
facebook.com. 

* Process of Loading a Webpage 
1. User types in 'google.com' into a web browser
2. DNS server looks at the domain name and maps it to the IP address that's 
needed, e.g. 192.168.1.4.
3. Once it gets that IP address, it then makes a HTTP request to the web server
of that IP address. 
4. That web server will return a response with the HTML/CSS files needed for
google.com to be loaded in the user's browser. 
- HTTP requests are made when you load a webpage and when you submit a form. 

* HTML
- Hypertext Markup Language is not a programming language. 
- It is purely visual and is a markup for creating webpages/documents. 

* CSS
- Stylesheet language used for styling HTML elements.
- Can be extended with Sass/Less. 

 * Roles of Web Technologies
 - HTML: content display/structure
 - CSS: style and design
 - JS: dynamic front end programming
 - PHP, Python, C#, JS: backend programming
 - MySQL, MongoDB: database/storage
